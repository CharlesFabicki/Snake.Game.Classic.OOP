# Snake Game OOP

This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries (`turtle`).

3. Run the `main.py` script using your Python interpreter.

4. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to control the snake's direction.

5. Your objective is to eat the food items that appear on the screen to increase your score.

6. Avoid running into the walls or into the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

## Game Features

- Snake segments grow in size as you eat food.
- A score display shows your current score.

## Controls

- Up Arrow: Move the snake up
- Down Arrow: Move the snake down

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the screen size, colors, and other parameters within the script files. The game's appearance can be adjusted to your preferences.
